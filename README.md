A growing number of viewers are looking for high quality, professional content on Dash, which is hard to find. I am trying to fill that gap and help you grow in the area of analytic web apps in Python.

My goal is to make this a sustainable project for myself and my viewers. This repository and my Charming Data channel is a 100% member-supported educational channel. Your support would mean a lot to me üôè

User Guide
Installation
I recommend installing pandas, since you will most likely use it.

$ pip install pandas
Then, just install Dash. Plotly comes with Dash

$ pip install dash
If you'd like to control the version of Plotly installed, you can do for example:

$ pip install plotly==5.7.0
